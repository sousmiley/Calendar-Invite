# ✦ Pin that Day ✦
*Pin that Day* is a Java based application that allows users to take note of special events! The system consists of two main components:
- Client Side : Built in Java using JavaSwing, this interface allows users to input details such as event type, date, location, and custom messages. Users can preview and manage their special events in an interactive environment with ease.
- Spring Boot Backend: The program information is handled between server and client using Spring Boot REST API. It supports functionalities like saving event data, retrieving events, and managing event details.
- The application reuses design patterns, such as the Factory design pattern, uses a MVC set up, and respects SOLID design principles. It uses engaging design to enable users to mark important events.
